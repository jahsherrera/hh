# SolarWinds Query Language (SWQL) Query Playground

## This is a public repository for some of my PowerShell scripts and the associated SWQL queries

**None of these queries are directly supported my myself nor SolarWinds.  Use them at your own risk.**

For more information about queries written in the SolarWinds Query Language (SWQL) you can find it in the [Orion SDK](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK) repository.

This is my playground for SWQL Queries that I think are interesting.  They are neither supported nor approved by SolarWinds directly.

### GENERAL DISCLAIMER

I write all of my scripts using many comments and I attempt to use full parameterization for all function calls for easier readability for new users of PowerShell and the SolarWinds Orion SDK.

I'm doing my best to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for all of my scripts.

This is the list of the VS Code Extensions that I'm using:

- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (v0.2.0)
- C/C++ (v1.0.1)
- C# (v1.23.4)
- GitHub Pull Requests and Issues (v0.20.1)
- GitLens - Git supercharged (v10.2.2)
- HTML (C#) v0.1.3
- IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML (v1.19.0)
- Jira and Bitbucket (Official) (v2.8.3)
- Khoros (v1.0.0)
- Live Server (v5.6.1)
- markdownlint (v0.37.1)
- PowerShell (v2020.6.0)
- Prettier - Code formatter (v5.7.1)
- Python (v2020.9.114305)
- Rainbow CSV (v1.7.1)
- Remote - WSL (v0.50.1)

**Note that this is my *full* list, not just the ones that I use for projects in this repository.**
