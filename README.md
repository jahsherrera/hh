# SolarWinds Query Language (SWQL) Query Playground
## This is a public repository for some of my PowerShell scripts and the associated SWQL queries.

**None of these queries are directly supported my myself nor SolarWinds.  Use them at your own risk.**

For more information about queries written in the SolarWinds Query Language (SWQL) you can find it in the [Orion SDK](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK) repository.

This is my playground for SWQL Queries that I think are interesting.  They are neither supported nor approved by SolarWinds directly.

###GENERAL DISCLAIMER:
I write all of my scripts using many comments and I attempt to use full parameterization for all function calls for easier readability for new users of PowerShell and the SolarWinds Orion SDK.
